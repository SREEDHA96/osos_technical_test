#   Document Analysis and Q&A System for "The Enigmatic Research of Dr. X"

##   Introduction

This system is designed to process, analyze, and enable interaction with documents related to "The Enigmatic Research of Dr. X". It employs a comprehensive NLP pipeline to extract content from various document formats, process it into searchable chunks, and provide advanced capabilities such as semantic search, translation, summarization, and retrieval-augmented question answering (RAG).

##   Core Capabilities

* Document extraction from multiple formats (.docx, .pdf, .csv, .xlsx, etc.)
   
* Text chunking and embedding generation
   
* Vector database creation for semantic search
   
* Question-answering with conversation support
   
* Translation between multiple languages
   
* Text summarization with evaluation metrics
   
* Specialized evaluation metrics for quality assessment

##   Methodology

The system follows a multi-stage process:

1.  **Document Extraction**: Extracts text and tables from various file formats using libraries like `python-docx`, `pdfplumber`, `pymupdf`, and `openpyxl`.
   
2.  **Text Chunking**: Divides the extracted text into manageable chunks while preserving semantic coherence and table integrity. The `tiktoken` library is used for tokenization.
   
3.  **Embedding Generation**: Generates vector embeddings for text chunks using the `nomic-embed-text-v1` model.
   
4.  **Vector Database Creation**: Creates a searchable vector database using FAISS (`faiss-cpu`) to enable semantic search.
   
5.  **RAG System**: Implements a question-answering system that retrieves relevant document chunks based on semantic similarity to the query, using the LLaMA-2 model to generate answers.
   
6.  **Translation System**: Translates documents between languages, with support for English and Arabic, using Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt models and applies grammar correction using the `vennify/t5-base-grammar-correction` model.
   
7.  **Summarization System**: Summarizes long texts using transformer-based models like BART, PEGASUS, and T5, and evaluates the summaries using ROUGE metrics.
   
8.  **Evaluation Metrics**: Employs several custom metrics, including Translation Preservation Score (TPS), Semantic Overlap Evaluation, Factual Consistency Score, and Answer Grounding Score, to assess the quality and performance of different components.

##   Significant Discoveries

* The importance of preserving table integrity during text chunking for maintaining data context.
   
* The effectiveness of sentence-based chunking over token-based chunking for improved semantic coherence.
   
* The utility of custom evaluation metrics like TPS and Factual Consistency Score for in-depth quality assessment of translation and summarization tasks.

##   LLM and Embedding Model

* **LLM**: LLaMA-2 model is used for the question-answering system.
   
* **Embedding Model**: `nomic-embed-text-v1` is used for generating text embeddings. Additionally, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is used in some evaluation metrics.

The documentation does not explicitly state how the LLaMA-2 model was obtained but mentions the use of Hugging Face's libraries (`transformers` and `huggingface_hub`) for accessing pre-trained models. It can be inferred that the LLaMA-2 model was likely accessed through the Hugging Face ecosystem.

The embedding models (`nomic-embed-text-v1` and `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) are also standard models available through libraries like Hugging Face's `transformers` or similar repositories.
